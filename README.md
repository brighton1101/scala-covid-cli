# US Covid 19 Data CLI

### A simple CLI to fetch data from [John Hopkins' Center for Systems Science and Engineering COVID 19 datasets](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

Dependencies:
- `sbt`
- `java 8+`

Still very much a WIP. Run the cli without args to get data from current date, or specify a date using the `-d` flag
